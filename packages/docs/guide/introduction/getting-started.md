# Getting started

## What is the `Base` class?

The `Base` class is born from our needs and practices with JavaScript as a team at [Studio Meta](https://www.studiometa.fr).

Its purposes are:

- Easily get elements from the DOM
- Register custom behaviours on component initialization
- Unregister these custom behaviours on component destruction
- Adding custom behaviours on page load, scroll and resize
- Adding custom behaviours on each frame with requestAnimationFrame
- Initialize components in the right place at the right time
- Define dependencies between components
